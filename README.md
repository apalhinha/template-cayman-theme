# template-cayman-theme
Simple GitHub site pages to be used as a template

Site is as-simple-as-possible, ready for my choices:
- Banner and github credits only appear in the index page
- Credit page exists and is ready to be filled in

Outcome (2 pages) can be seen in https://apalhinha.github.io/template-cayman-theme
